# Smart Warehouse

The Smart Warehouse project is aimed at providing online stores with an efficient solution for tracking orders and controlling stock.
By automating these processes, the project ensures timely delivery updates and better organization of the warehouse.
To achieve this, three interconnected services have been designed: Sale service, Stock Room service, and LogiHub service. 
These services communicate via gRPC and incorporate various features to streamline the entire process. 
Additionally, a Graphical User Interface has been developed for each service to enable easy viewing, control, and invocation of the services/devices. 
The benefits of this project extend beyond efficient stock management and order control, 
making it an attractive proposition for companies looking to optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction.
